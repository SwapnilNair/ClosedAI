> *It's approaching a very strange situation where people make overly wordy and bloated AI generated content and other people try to use AI to compress it back into useful pellets vaguely corresponding to the actual prompts used to generate the initial content. One guy pays the AI to dig a hole, the other guy pays the AI to fill in the hole. Back and forth they go, raising the Valuation but otherwise not accomplishing anything.*

- **Two are independent, The third is chaos**
    
    A friend asked me if I could recollect the name of the theorem that rather vaguely states that “two bodies act independently and in predictable fashion but add a third and all that independence vanishes”. These are all the theorems I came across when going through a rabbit hole while trying to remember what it was.
    
    1. **Conway’s Free Will Theorem**, the idea is that two systems, when considered independently, might have a certain degree of "free will" (in the sense of independence or unpredictability). But once a third system is introduced, that freedom is constrained. Essentially, the theorem suggests that if experimenters have free will in choosing measurement settings, then the outcomes of quantum measurements must also exhibit a form of "free will."
    2. **Kochen-Specker Theorem** similarly shows that in quantum mechanics, it is impossible to assign definite values (truth or false) to quantum properties in a way that remains consistent when considering combinations of different measurements.
    3. **The Three-Body Problem**:
    This is a famous problem in classical mechanics. While two bodies (like planets) interacting through gravity can have predictable and independent orbits, adding a third body makes the system chaotic and unpredictable. The system becomes so interdependent that the motions of the three bodies can no longer be solved with a simple, closed-form solution.
    4. **Monod's Cooperation Theorem**:
    In biological systems, this theorem deals with cooperative interactions between organisms. When you have two organisms interacting independently, they may behave in a way that is mutually beneficial. But when you add a third, it can introduce competitive or interdependent dynamics that disrupt that independence.
    5. **Braess's Paradox (in Networks)**:
    In network theory, Braess's Paradox shows that adding extra resources (like a new road in a traffic network) can actually make things worse for everyone, making the system more interdependent and less efficient. Similarly, two systems might function well on their own, but adding a third path can create unexpected negative consequences.
    6. **Game Theory – Nash Equilibrium**:
    In some multi-agent games, two players might act independently and reach an equilibrium. However, introducing a third player often makes the equilibrium more complex and forces all players into a more interdependent relationship, constraining their strategies and outcomes.
    7. **Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem (Social Choice Theory)**:
    In voting systems, Arrow’s theorem shows that no rank-order voting system can meet all fairness criteria when there are three or more options. With two candidates or options, certain fairness properties can be maintained. However, adding a third creates conflicts between fairness criteria, making independent preferences impossible to maintain.
    8. **Bell's Theorem (Quantum Mechanics)**:
    This theorem demonstrates that no theory of hidden variables can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics if it maintains locality. When two particles are entangled, their states remain independent until measured. However, if a third observer or particle is introduced, the independence collapses, showing the nonlocal nature of quantum systems.
    9. **Synergy in Systems Biology**:
    In biological systems, two entities (like genes or enzymes) might function independently of each other. However, the addition of a third can lead to *synergistic effects*, where the whole system’s behavior becomes more complex than the sum of its parts. This introduces interdependence that wasn’t present before.
    10. **Simmel's Triad (Sociology)**:
    German sociologist Georg Simmel explored how the dynamics of human relationships change when moving from dyads (two people) to triads (three people). In a dyad, relationships are direct and independent, but adding a third person creates a new level of interdependence and complexity, often leading to coalition formation or power struggles.
    11. **Triadic Closure (Graph Theory/Social Networks)**:
    In social networks, if two people (nodes) are connected and both are friends with a third person, the chances of the two unconnected individuals forming a relationship increase. This creates a closed triangle of relationships, interlinking all three nodes, thus limiting their independence.
    12. **Karp’s 21 NP-Complete Problems**:
    In computational complexity theory, many NP-complete problems involve graphs or systems where independent optimization of two parts might be manageable, but as you add constraints (effectively introducing a “third variable”), finding optimal solutions becomes interdependent and difficult.
    13. **Triple Constraint in Project Management (Iron Triangle)**:
    In managing projects, the triple constraint refers to the interdependence of *scope*, *time*, and *cost*. You can independently adjust two of these, but the third becomes constrained by the others, making it impossible to optimize one without affecting the others.
